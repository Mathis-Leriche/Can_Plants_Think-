Here is our repository. The files are stored by plant. The results are saved in csv files named "AT_S2_P1.csv" for example. AT corresponds to Arabidopsis Thaliana, HA to Helianthus Annuus and NT to Nicotina Tabacum. S2 is rfor week 2. P1, for example, corresponds to position 1. The positions and the modality of the experiment are explained in the article.
